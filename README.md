# Pixel operation and Histogram (Operasi piksel dan Histogram)
(the code is not available yet). 

This is a program to process pixel value from image using cv2, numpy and visualize the pixels in histogram using matplotlib.pyplot.

nb:
The code is not good enough since I just started to learn OOP. But it works.
